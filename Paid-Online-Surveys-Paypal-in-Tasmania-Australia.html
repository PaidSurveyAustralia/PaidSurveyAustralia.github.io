    <p>
      - Register Fee: The 
      majority of the scam web sites 
      online usually request a subscribe cost. This 
      is prohibited and also uncalled 
      for. Taking surveys online is free, so don't pay to sign up

      survey site that does not reveal their 
      payment approach depends on something. It is a bad indication, 
      please avoid those websites. High 
      Minimum Cashout: Most of the scam online
